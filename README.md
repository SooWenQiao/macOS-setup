# macOS-setup
A simple settings script to wifi connection, terminal configuration and languages installation. 
To run the script, do: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SooWenQiao/macOS-setup.git
cd macOS-setup
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

## Remark: 
1. The hello.sh is executed inside setup.sh to check if the installation is properly undergone. It will create a directory 'iniproj'
2. People should customise setup.sh
3. Any successful attempts to insert nusstu.mobileconfig as macOS profile is welcomed. Thank you for any suggestion, I'm too new to this.
